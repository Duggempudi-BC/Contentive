Tone of Voice: Professional and narrative. It should tell a story about the client's challenge and your solution.
Ideal Length: Usually 500-1500 words. Enough to detail the problem, solution, and results without overwhelming the reader.
Key Elements: Background information, the problem statement, the solution provided, results and benefits, and testimonials or quotes from the client. Visual elements like graphs or before-and-after comparisons can be effective.

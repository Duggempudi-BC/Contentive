Tone of Voice: Professional yet engaging. It should be concise and to the point, but also personable to build a connection with the reader.
Ideal Length: Generally, keep it short and sweet, around 100-200 words. The key is to convey your message quickly since recipients often skim through emails.
Key Elements: A compelling subject line, a clear call-to-action (CTA), personalization (like using the recipient's name), and visually appealing design. Include links to relevant content or offers.

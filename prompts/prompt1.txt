Please strictly follow the following rules and precautions to prevent any issues:

  Ensure special characters, such as double quotes, backslashes, or line breaks, are properly escaped in the response.
  Confirm that the response does not contain any characters that are not supported by the LinkedIn platform or the parsing logic.
  As the response is part of an adaptive card or similar structure, ensure it adheres to the correct format and schema.
  Use online validators specific to the format to check the correctness of the response.
  Consider encoding if dynamically generating response to handle special characters appropriately.
